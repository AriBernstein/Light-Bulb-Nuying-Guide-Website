			<h2>CFL vs. LED</h2>
			<p>Compact Fluorescent (CFL) and Light Emitting Diode (LED) bulbs are the most energy-efficient light bulb options. They have lower wattage than incandescent bulbs, but emit the same light output. This allows them to produce the same amount of light, but use less energy. View the chart for key differences.</p>
			<h3>A few more facts:</h3>
			<p>CFLs:</p>
			
			<p>An electric current flows between electrodes at each end of a tube containing gases. The reaction
			produces ultraviolet (UV) light and heat. The UV light is transformed into visible light when it strikes a
			phosphor coating on the inside of the bulb.</p>

			<p>Available for outdoor use; just make sure the packaging indicates the bulb is rated for outdoor use.
			May not hold up to the stress of power surges, so using them in areas such as workshops isn’t advisable.
			If the outlet is wired for a dimmer or three-way bulb, make sure you purchase a CFL rated for the specific use.</p>
			<p>LEDs</p>
			<p>These bulbs use an electrical current passed through semiconductor material to illuminate the tiny diodes
			called LEDs. The heat produced is absorbed into a heat sink, keeping the bulbs cool to the touch.
			Available for outdoor use; just make sure the packaging indicates the bulb is rated for outdoor use.
			Does not contribute to heat buildup, which helps save on air conditioning.</p>

			<h2>Incandescent Bulbs</h2>
			<p>In 2007 Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act requiring new energy-efficient standards for basic light bulbs. All standard 100-, 75-, 60- and 40-watt incandescent bulbs are being phased out and will no longer be produced. Standard incandescent bulbs will still be available to purchase while supplies last. A number of specialty incandescent bulbs, such as chandalier bulbs, will remain available.</p>

			<h2>Fluorescent Bulbs</h2>
			<p>Fluorescent bulbs or tubes are filled with mercury vapor that emits UV light when electricity is applied. The bulbs/tubes have a coating inside that turns the UV rays into visible light.</p>


			<h2>Halogen Bulbs</h2>
			<p>Halogen bulbs use a filament that’s heated to the point of glowing, the same as incandescent bulbs, but they use less energy.</p>

			<h2>HID Bulbs</h2>
			<p>High Intensity Discharge (HID) bulbs are primarily used in larger spaces such as warehouses, commercial buildings or in streetlights. They are filled with sodium or mercury vapor that conducts electricity. HID bulbs don't have filaments like most light bulbs, so they last longer.</p>

			<h2>Lumens and Watts</h2>
			<h3>Lumens:</h3>
			<p>the amount of light emitted from a light bulb. More lumens equals brighter light, fewer lumens equals dimmer light. Standard 100-watt bulbs produce about 1600 lumens.</p>
			<h3>Watts:</h3>
			<p>The amount of energy a light bulb uses. The lower the watts, the lower the electric bill. CFLs and LEDs have a lower wattage than incandescent bulbs, but emit the same light output.</p>
