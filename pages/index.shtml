				<h2>Definition:</h2>
				<p>A glass bulb inserted into a lamp or a socket in a ceiling which provides light by passing an electric current through a filament or a pocket of inert gas.</p>

				<h2>Purpose:</h2>
				<p>The purpose of the light bulb is to provide enough light to supplement daylight. Light bulbs enable humans to be uninhibited and non-inconvenienced by lack of natural light, without many of the dangers of candles or gas lamps (the technologies replaced by the light bulb).</p>

				<h2>Impact on Society:</h2>

				<p>Few inventions have had greater impacts on society. Over the past century, light bulbs have become ubiquitous, both indoors and outdoors; you would be hard-pressed to find a room without one. Street lights line nearly every street. </p>

			<h2>Types of light bulbs:</h2>
			<div class="separatedList">
				<h3>The Incandecent Light Bulb</h3>
				<img class="leftObjects" src="../media/realBulbGraphics/incandescent/incandescentBulbGraphic1Shadow.png" alt="incandescent light bulb">
				<p class="indentedText">The incandescent light bulb or lamp is a source of electric light that works by incandescence, which is the emission of light caused by heating the filament. They are made in an extremely wide range of sizes, wattages, and voltages.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="separatedList">
				<h3>The LED (Light Emitting Diode)</h3>
				<img class="leftObjects" src="../media/realBulbGraphics/led/ledBulbTransparentShadow.png" alt="led light bulb">
				<p class="indentedText">LED light bulbs or lamps utilize light-emitting diodes in order to produce light. LED is a “solid-state” technology, which means that the materials used to generate the light are encased within a solid material. Practically, this translates into a lamp with a rated life much longer than those using non-solid-state technology (such as incandescent, halogen, and fluorescent). Solid-state lighting is also much less susceptible to failure due to shock or vibration.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="separatedList">
				<h3>The HID (High Intensity Discharge)</h3>
				<img class="leftObjects" src="../media/realBulbGraphics/hid/hid-single-lamp.png" alt="hid light bulb">
				<p class="indentedText">HID, or high-intensity discharge light bulbs and lamps, are a family of gas-discharge arc lamps which create light by sending an electrical discharge between two electrodes and through a plasma, or ionized gas. An additional gas is generally used, and this gas serves as an easy way to classify the major types of HID lamps: Mercury, sodium, and metal halide. </p>

				<p>These lamps are known for their high efficiency at turning electricity into light and their long rated life. HID lamps require a ballast in order to generate the initial surge of electricity needed to start them and to regulate their power during normal operation.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="separatedList">
				<h3>The Compact Fluorescent Bulb</h3>
				<img class="leftObjects" src="../media/realBulbGraphics/fluorescent/compactFluorescent/compactFluorescentShadow.png" alt="compactFluorescent light bulb">
				<p class="indentedText">The compact fluorescent light bulb or lamp is a type of fluorescent lamp generally designed as a replacement for incandescent or halogen lamps. There are two major types of compact fluorescent lamp, screw-in and plug-in.</p>
				<p>Screw in lamps are self-ballasted and can generally be placed in an existing screw socket without any additional equipment, plug-in bulbs require a ballast and a socket that corresponds to their specific base configuration. These are also sometimes referred to as integrated (screw base) and non-integrated (plug base).</p>
				<p>Both come in a wide variety of wattages, sizes, color temperatures, and base types, and they are known primarily for their efficiency, long life, low cost, and ease of upgrading.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="separatedList">
				<h3>The Linear Fluorescent Bulb</h3>
				<img class="leftObjects" src="../media/realBulbGraphics/fluorescent/linearFluorescent/linear-fluorescentFlipped.png" alt="linear fluorescent light bulb">
				<p class="indentedText">The linear fluorescent light bulb or lamp is a type of gas-discharge lamp. Linear fluorescent bulbs come in a wide variety of lengths, diameters, wattages, and color temperatures. They are known for high energy efficiency, long life, and relatively low cost.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="separatedList">
				<h3>The Halogen Light Bulb</h3>
				<img class="leftObjects" src="../media/realBulbGraphics/halogen/flippedHalogenBulbShadow.png" alt="halogen light bulb">
				<p class="indentedText">The halogen light bulb or lamp is a type of incandescent lamp which uses a halogen gas in order to increase both light output and rated life. They are known for moderately high efficiency, quality of light, and high rated life compared to regular incandescent lamps.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="separatedList">
				<h3>The Germicidal Light Bulb</h3>
				<img class="leftObjects" src="../media/realBulbGraphics/germicidal/germicidalSized.png" alt="germicidal light bulb">
				<p class="indentedText">A germicidal light bulb or lamp is designed to use a combination of special phosphors and a quartz glass envelope for the process of eliminating germs and/or the creation of ozone. They come in a variety of wattages, voltages, sizes, and base types. They produce little if any visible light and are designed primarily for the purpose of sterilization or ozone creation.</p>
